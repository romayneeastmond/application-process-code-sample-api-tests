"Oh, I see! Yes, that makes sense. Thank you!!" She smiles broadly. "Now, is there anything I could do for you?”

“I need to find Noah's office,” you say, brandishing the razor. There's a 'situation' I need to resolve.”

"Oh, his office is right over there." Tina points to a door with an imposing-looking keypad.  "But you'll need the key code to get inside."

"What's the code?" you ask, knowing it's not going to be that easy.

"I don't have it, but I know how you can get it. Around here, if you need access, you need to talk to Justin." She points towards an open door at the end of a short hallway.


You head down the hallway and peek through the open doorway into Justin's office. A man with a magnificent red beard is staring morosely at a dark monitor. "No! Not you, Bob, not you, too! First Kevin, and now Bob. Both dead long before their time, and they still had so much work to do!"

"What!?" you exclaim. Do they work their employees to death here?

"Yep, Bob went to sleep, and I can't wake him back up. I fear we've lost another build machine," Justin says.

Ahh, Bob the build machine, Bob the Builder!  These guys have an odd sense of humor, you think to yourself.

"Can I help?" you ask.

"Well, it might cheer me up if you showed me something interesting and fun," he says cheekily.
